ImageURIGen (Image Data URI generator) is a simple web service which generates
base64 encoded image data URI response in JSON format for a given set of image 
URLs. The image URLs can be passed as HTTP GET or POST query string parameters.
Internally the web service reads the image URLs from the query string, opens 
them as jpeg using gd's imagecreatefromjpeg function and saves them as jpeg again
in a temporal file, that is then read and encoded as base64, and then deleted.

This process is necessary encode correct jpegs (for jsPDF at least) without depending
on the input jpegs being correct (again, from jsPDF's point of view).

Sample request and response
Request:
http://hostedserver/services/urigen.php?params={"images":["http://images.apple.com/mac/home/images/productbrowser/macbookpro.jpg","http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/pics/logos/logoEbay_x45.gif"]}
Response:
{"data":[
	{"url":"http:\/\/images.apple.com\/mac\/home\/images\/productbrowser\/macbookpro.jpg"","uri":"\/9j\/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAZABkAAD\/........5AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEH\/\/z"},
	{"url":"http:\/\/p.ebaystatic.com\/aw\/pics\/logos\/logoEbay_x45.gif","uri":"R0lGODlhbgAtANUAALIAJpnMAAAAmczl.......B4NmdQZTJ5QUFBQUFFbEZUa1N1UW1DQw=="}
	]
}

to be in place based on the image response headers
3. If images are hosted by the same publisher who hosts the web service then
the images can be maintained in the same web server as the web service (or 
vice versa) and totally avoid CURL calls. Subsequent disk reads can alos be 
avoided if caching mechanism is setup
4. Cache headers sent in the final web service JSON response itself can be
tweaked in accordance with the actual image cache headers to maximize the 
usage of browser cache

Limitation: IE6 & IE7 do not directly support image data URI, a
possible technique is explained here http://www.phpied.com/inline-mhtml-data-uris/
but I would not recommend it.
